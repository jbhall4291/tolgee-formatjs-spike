            Experience an Exciting Life in Spain
Hello! I'm Carolina Sofia Arolfo Niveyro, a law student at UOC, and I'm also certified as an expert by the European Institute of Tax Advisory for the Advanced Course in Foreigners Law, Nationality, and Mobility.



My life has crossed borders, living in Argentina, England, Italy, and currently in Malaga, Spain, facing challenges like Brexit, pandemics, and international crises.

My family's experience has led me to handle all kinds of migratory procedures, navigating legislative changes in immigration throughout my experiences, thus enriching my knowledge.

My global network of friendships has inspired my passion for bringing people together, overcoming migratory barriers. International moves, new cities, career and profession changes, combined with my curiosity to efficiently apply myself in each process to save time and money, led me to train and become an expert in immigration services. I'm here to help you overcome any obstacles and make your experience smooth and successful.



Whether in the UK, Italy, or Spain, I've had the opportunity to manage various types of residencies, citizenships, marriage registrations, births, divorces, deaths, registrations, proof of life certificates for retirement/pensions, driver's license exchanges, recognition/homologation of academic titles from non-EU countries, family reunifications, residence for family members of Union citizens, translations in English, Spanish, and Italian, certification of no-renunciation of Italian citizenship, procedures with Argentine, American, and Italian consulates, long-term property rentals, residence by investment (golden visa), assembling files for Italian citizenship, searching for Italian records, and much more!



Tell me your story; together, we'll find the best solution that suits your needs. I'll guide you on this journey so you can focus on enjoying your new life in Spain.
